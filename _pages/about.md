# About Me
My name is Songpeng Zu, coming from Liaoning Province, China. I got bachelor
degree on biological science and technology in the School of Life Science at
Tsinghua Univeristy, 2011. Then got the PhD degree on bioinformatics supervised
by Prof. Shao Li in the Department of Automation, Tsinghua Univeristy,
Jan, 2017. My thesis focused on applying statistical machine learning on the
inference of drug-protein interactions. 

As a machine learning researcher, I joined the recommendation team in HULU,
Beijing right after my graduation, where I learned how to program seriously, how to handle
big data, and especially how to use deep learning models on the online
recommendation system. 

In Nov 2018, I joined the DAMA Academy, Alibaba, as an senior algorithm
engineering, where together with our team, we apply different deep learning
techniques on the so called CityBrain project. From Alibaba, I learned the
courage to challenge yourself, think big, and do quickly. It's an amazing
experience. More importantly, it encourages me to choose what I really what to do in
my whole life. 

In Aug 2019, I left Alibaba and start again my academic career, which is always
my dream. I am now a Post Doctoral supervised by Prof. Jun Liu, at Harvard
University, Cambridge, MA. I focus on developing the algorithms on single-cell
sequencing data, and study tumor immunotherapy.
