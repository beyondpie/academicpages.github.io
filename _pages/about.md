# About Me
My name is Songpeng Zu, coming from Liaoning Province, China. I got Bachelor
in Biological Science in the School of Life Science at
Tsinghua Univeristy, 2011. Then got the PhD on Control Science and Engineer supervised
by Prof. Shao Li in the Department of Automation, Tsinghua Univeristy,
Jan, 2017. My thesis focused on applying statistical machine learning on the
predicting drug-protein interactions. 

As a machine learning researcher, I joined the recommendation team in HULU,
Beijing right after my graduation, where I learned how to program seriously, how to handle
big data, and especially how to use deep learning models on the online
recommendation system. 

In Nov 2018, as an algorithm expert, I joined Tianji Team, CityBrain Lab under DAMO Academy, Alibaba. From Alibaba, I learned the
courage to challenge self, think big, and act quickly. It's an amazing
experience. More importantly, it encourages me to rethink what I really what to do for
my whole life. 

In Aug 2019, I left Alibaba and started again my academic career, which is always
my dream. I am now a Post Doctoral Fellow supervised by Prof. Jun Liu, at Harvard
University, Cambridge, MA. I focus on statistical algorithm development and data analysis on single-cell
sequencing data and tumor immunotherapy.
